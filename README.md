# first_repository
My first GitHub repository 

Hello there! This is my first GitHub repository. Hope this will be a great start to my coding career. 
I'm studying Computational Linguistics so coding is an utmost necessity for me, though I will mostly work with Python, Im still eager to learn more languages along the way.
